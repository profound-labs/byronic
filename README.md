The [Byronic hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byronic_hero):

> The Byronic hero is a variant of the Romantic hero as a type of character,
> named after the English Romantic poet Lord Byron. Both Byron's life and
> writings have been considered in different ways to exemplify the type. The
> Byronic hero first appears in Byron's semi-autobiographical epic narrative poem
> Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812–1818), and was described by the historian and
> critic Lord Macaulay as "a man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his
> brow, and misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge,
> yet capable of deep and strong affection".
>
> Byron described Conrad, the pirate hero of his The Corsair (1814) as follows:
>
> That man of loneliness and mystery,
> Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh— (I, VIII)
